# Digizilla's Task
Here is my repo for the task .. 
I decided to use Python as a new experience , searched for the several options but I foud that Bottle is the best choice for the task its easy light framework to use ..
For the Mysql db , I tried to use several sql mapers ( sqlalchmy , peewee ) but i failed alot of errors and no time ,  
so I have decided to move on  and use sql queries .
For the client side I have used Angular2 . ( Didn't test the integration with the Api ) , I was testing useing Postman app .

The task list : 
-[X] Creating simple login form using the following
-[X] GET & POST method
-[X] Server side validation ( just semple one for the pw )
-[X] Authentication of supplied user(must have a ready database in mysql)
-[X] Forgot password/Reset password link (sends email) ( not tested )
-[X] Use ajax for submitting the form (if you've knowledge of ajax)
I have assumed that mean with Ajax the way for connecting the server through js not the specific way of XML 
-[X] Create a simple user profile page (Name, email and password)
-[X] Use session and cookies for a 2-3 step application (Login form->Login Success Page->My Profile) 
-[X] Create a large file uploading page ( not tested )
-[ ] Use various reserved server level variables to know server info, browser info 
-[ ] Use constants for storing global variables and use them.
Why ! Anyway the constants in python just a varible in capital and for global just use global key word when you change a global variable
-[ ] Use one API like google maps API for creating simple app like distance calculator.
I found 2 resources that would use for that if I had more time I will use to biuld a distance cul beteewn 2 location from the map :
[ Here ] ( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/distancematrix) and [ Here ] ( http://brianflove.com/2016/10/18/angular-2-google-maps-places-autocomplete/)
-[X] Create a web services/API for your application.
